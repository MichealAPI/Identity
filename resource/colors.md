## Colors

Colors follow the [MiniMessage Syntax](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html). You can refer to their documentation for more details.\

Animations are a beautiful part of Identity; you can animate elements text by using the following format, just like the **MiniMessage** format: `<animate:#color1:#color2></animate>` (The closing tag, as always, is optional and goes according to your needs). If you need help coloring, please visit the resource above.

{% hint style="info" %}
To adjust the animation speed, navigate to the config and then to settings. Modify the '**animation-interval**' option to a lower value (**default**: 2, **min**: 1). **Note**: Lowering this value can **significantly impact performance**.
