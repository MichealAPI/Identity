# Introduction

There are **4 types** of inventories, each of them has **its own properties** that **can be set up**. There is **no limit** in creating inventories, you can even fill up the Main one with page systems which contain other Custom GUIs. The only limit is your imagination! Here's a list of **inventory types**, each with its own brief description and a link to the setup section of that specific inventory:

* **Main GUI**: This primary inventory serves as the gateway to other setup inventories. It also acts as the fallback GUI when a mandatory inventory is incomplete and the player attempts to close or confirm.
* **Input GUI**: Allows the player to input text governed by configurable options. An optional, fully customizable anti-spam filter can also be applied.
* **Value GUI**: Allows the player to select and modify a value with configurable base, maximum, and minimum limits. Create buttons to subtract, multiply, divide, or add specific values to the target. Everything is customizable.
* **Selector GUI**: Lets players select their preferred value by clicking on available configured buttons.
