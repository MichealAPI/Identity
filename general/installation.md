# Installation

## Download

You can purchase and download Identity from these marketplaces as a premium plugin:&#x20;

* [Polymart](https://polymart.org)
* [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com)

## Installation Guide

To install this plugin, simply place the downloaded `.jar` file into your server's `plugins` folder. That's it! Upon starting your server, the plugin will generate configuration files which you can customize to fit your needs.



## Custom GUI

This is a very mechanical procedure, as illustrated by the Name, Gender & Age preset included when you download the plugin. For more detailed guidance, refer to the resources listed below. Should you require additional support, don't hesitate to reach out to us at [discord.mikeslab.it](https://discord.mikeslab.it).

1. Setup negative spaces
2. Associate your custom inventory texture to a random emoji. You can get a random emoji from sources like Perchance. For example, visit [Perchance Emoji Generator](https://perchance.org/emoji).
3.  To create a new Identity inventory configuration:

    1. _Follow the provided guidelines._
    2. _If you need assistance, visit the Inventory Configuration section._

    Ensure all steps are completed to properly set up your configuration. For further help, consult the relevant documentation.
4. Next step requires you to set up your title. This is a very mechanical procedure. Firstly, add the `<white>` color, then insert a random amount of negative space characters, around 40px. Finally, add the inventory-associated emoji.
5. To save and reload your identity, use the command `/identity reload`. After reloading, check your new inventory. You may need to adjust any negative spaces to fit the inventory size. Due to Minecraft limitations, this is currently the best and only method available.
6. Enjoy!
